# Data Portrait of Siddharth Chattoraj's Sent Instagram DMs
MAT 236: Project 2
By: Siddharth Chattoraj

## Project Functionality

This data portrait depics all Instgram DMs I have sent in my lifetime, from when I first downloaded in Instagram in November 2017 to November 2025. Users can toggle between daily, monthly, yearly, hourly, and overall views, and they can select each bar from the chart at the bottom to learn more about my DMing habits at that moment in my life. On thr right side, there is a dashboard that displays top word formations, top emojis, and message statistics, and users can click to proceed to the next moment in time. On the left side, there is an interactive 3D word embedding space graph that displays what terms were used in similar contexts for that moment in time, according to data from a Word2Vec model I created. Closer terms represent words used in similar contexts.

## Design Principles

When I send messages, unless I'm very close with the recipient, my approach has been to spend time curating the words within my messages to portray a specific tone (e.g. using "i" vs. "me", or using "yes" vs. "yas" vs. "yea" vs. "yaas") or to provide a level of detail (e.g. if asking about hiking in Seattle, mentioning specific terms like the "Cascades" rather than being vague) that enables me to receive a message back quickly directly. When I'm messaging people close to me, my approach has been to DM freely in short bursts without as much care to the exact tone or detail being conveyed. However, I am interested in what the overarching picture of my direct messages appear like and what words I frequently use in which contexts to better understand how I communicate overall. 

In developing this project, I was inspired by existing interactive embedding explorers like [TensorFlow's Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) and social media/application data visualizers like [Stats for Spotify](https://www.statsforspotify.com/), but I wanted to apply these existing methods to Instagram—a messaging tool I use frequently—on a deeper scale to visualize the specific ways and frequency by which I communicate.
