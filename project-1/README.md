# Pattern Illustrator
**By: Siddharth Chattoraj**

## Overview

Pattern Illustrator is a drawing and animation tool that enables users to directly design symmetric pattern drawings or generate sketches with Gemini. All illustrations created within the tool are built from a series of strokes, and the user can modify these strokes to improve the overall aesthetic of the drawing. Pattern Illustrator further provides users with the power to visualize an animation between up to 10 illustrations created within the platform.
