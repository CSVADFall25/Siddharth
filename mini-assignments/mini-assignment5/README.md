This is a collaboration between Joel Jaffe and Siddharth Chattoraj.

This is designed for the Daisy Seed connected to an accelerometer.

**Instructions:**

Direction: The X reading steers left/right (lower = left, higher = right). The Y reading steers up/down (higher = up, lower = down). It keeps moving while a side or up/down reading is past its limit.

Size: The Z reading sets brush thickness: low = thin, middle = medium, high = thick.

Color: The line takes a rainbow color based on the direction it’s moving; if it’s not moving, it stays white.

Reset: Press R to put the brush back in the center. Space tries to reconnect. Calibration is fixed (no extra steps needed).
